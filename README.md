GameDocs
========

This is a repository for me to put any game hack documentation that I've
worked on.  Mainly it is for annotated disassemblies of game programs.

The one you're probably looking for is "mspac.asm", my annotated 
disassembly of Ms. Pac-Man, which I couldn't have done without the 
help from many people on the net.  Thank you all so much for contributing
to this project!
